# Interactive digital frame with head-tracking using Three.js & TensorFlow.js

Using [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), this project is a prototype of an interactive digital art frame using head-tracking to create an effect of head-coupled perspective.

A famous use of this effect can be found in the [Ghost Protocol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydIPKkjBlMw&t=30s) movie.

I wanted to experiment with making interactive art pieces so this project is a PWA that can be run fullscreen on an iPad.

:info: This is a prototype made as a side project so the code is not production-ready. Its performance is not optimised so the first load can take a while. :info:
